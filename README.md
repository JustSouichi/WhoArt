# WhoArt

WhoArt is a simple CLI tool that displays your GitHub profile as an ASCII art image, alongside key profile information such as your username, bio, public repositories, followers, and more.

**Why is WhoArt useful?**  
When configuring your Git credentials with `git config`, it can often be unclear who exactly you are setting up, especially when there are multiple accounts or complex configurations. This can lead to confusion and mistakes. **WhoArt** helps solve this problem by showing exactly **who you are** in a simple, clear way, by displaying your GitHub profile as an ASCII image and including all your important details. Now, you wonâ€™t have to wonder who you are when working with Git.

**Warning:**
- **Works best in default terminals** such as **macOS Terminal** (xterm - 256 color) and other similar terminal environments.
- ASCII art rendering and colors may not appear correctly in terminals with limited color support.
